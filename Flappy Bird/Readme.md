Flappy Bird Game

I created a Flappy Bird game that features:

A bird that responds to clicks, taps, or the spacebar

Randomly generated pipes to navigate through

Score tracking

Game over detection

Restart functionality

I also made some improvements in version 1.

How I Play

I click, tap, or press the spacebar to make the bird jump.

I navigate through the gaps between the pipes.

I earn 1 point for each pipe I pass.

The game ends if I hit a pipe or the ground.

I try to beat my high score!

Game Features

Responsive canvas-based gameplay

Physics simulation with gravity and jumping

Randomly generated pipes

Score tracking and high score

Game state management (start, play, game over)

Works with both mouse/touch and keyboard controls

I built the game using HTML Canvas for rendering and React for the UI components. The birdâ€™s physics, pipe generation, and collision detection are all handled in the game loop.
